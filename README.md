This is a [React.js](https://legacy.reactjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`poppins/fonts`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## About Project
